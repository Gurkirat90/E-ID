# E-ID
This project implements a deep learning pipeline for biometric identification and verification using ECG (Electrocardiogram) signals. Leveraging a Siamese 1D Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN), the system learns to distinguish between individual heart signal patterns, enabling personal identity recognition from physiological data.
