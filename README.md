This project implements a deep learning pipeline for biometric identification and verification using ECG (Electrocardiogram) signals. Leveraging a Siamese 1D Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN), the system learns to distinguish between individual heart signal patterns, enabling personal identity recognition from physiological data. As part of this research, I authored a paper which concluded that even a 1-minute ECG recording is sufficient, efficient, and effective for identifying an individual and storing their data in a biometric system database. The paper was accepted at UPWOIEN 2025, with the presentation scheduled for 30â€“31 October 2025. Following the conference, the paper will be published on IEEE Xplore and will also be accessible via Google Scholar.
